Description
-----------

This is the first of a series of workshops hosted by the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core (BBC).
Each of the examples that we work through today are "toy" examples based on time and compute resources available (e.g. your laptop).
However, this workshop aims to have everything be in the context of genomics/transcriptomics and larger, "real" data sets.
The next iteration of the workshop will introduce the High Performance Computing (HPC) resource here at VARI to begin analyzing the larger data sets.
However, it is advised that if you plan on attending (and we hope you do!) the HPC workshop, that you take this short course first since interacting with the HPC is done primarily in the shell.

This course assumes little to no prior knowledge of working in the shell. 


Topics overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This workshop will focus on introducing the shell (also known as the terminal/command line) including topics such as:

* What is the shell?
* How do you access it?
* How do you use it? (viewing files, manipulating files, automating tasks, etc.)
* What is it good for and why should I care?
* Additional available resources

We ask that if you are in attendance that you stay for the entire workshop due to limited space and that each topic builds on the previous one.
However, we recognize that science doesn't stop and if you need to leave early for an experiment, that's fine.
The materials will continue to persist on the web and can be accessed outside of the Institute if you would like to reference them at a later date.

Computer requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Already changing things up**
**The following is required but will probably be better suited for the next workshop: Intro to the HPC**
Attendees will need to bring a computer with a Web browser, an
Internet connection, and an ssh client; Windows users should install
`MobaXterm <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`__ before the workshop.

**Windows users need to install Git bash**
*Windows:*

1. Download the Git for Windows installer `here <https://git-for-windows.github.io/>`__.
2. Follow install instructions.

   * Click "next"
   * Click "next"
   * Click "next"
   * Click "next"
   * Click "next"
   * Select **"Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"** and click on "next".  If you forget to do this, re-run the installer and select the correct option.
   * Click "next", keep **"Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"** selected.
   * Select **"Use Windows' default console window"** and click on "next"
   * Click on "next"
   * Click on "finish"

*Mac OS X:*

The default shell in Mac OS X is bash, so you can access the Terminal from /Applications/Utilities (go to your Applications folder, then go to the Utilities window.  You should see "Terminal" there)

What can I expect to take away?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This workshop will provide an introduction to commonly used shell commands and how to integrate them together for *some* useful file manipulations.
However, it is by no means a comprehensive course that would enable you to be an expert upon exiting the door at 5 pm.
There may be times of pure frustration, but we've provided some coffee and some really cool people (Megan Bowman and Zach Madaj) to help when you want to throw your computer.
We hope that this will provide a starting point and just enough to be dangerous that will allow you to (ultimately) leverage large public databases and analyze your (or other's) sequencing data!
